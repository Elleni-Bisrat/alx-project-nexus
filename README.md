# Project Nexus: ProDev Frontend Engineering Learnings

## Overview
Project Nexus is a personal documentation hub that captures my learnings, challenges, and experiences from the **ProDev Frontend Engineering program**.  
This repository showcases my understanding of modern frontend development concepts, tools, and best practices.

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Technologies Covered
- **Frontend Development:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, NativeWind, React Native
- **Mobile Development:** Expo, React Native navigation, UI design patterns
- **Backend Integration:** REST APIs, GraphQL, Postman testing
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA):** Service workers, offline support
- **Version Control & Collaboration:** Git, GitHub, pull requests, branching strategies

### 2. Frontend Concepts
- Component-based architecture and reusability
- State management (React state, context API)
- Responsive and mobile-first design
- API integration and data fetching (Axios, fetch)
- Styling with TailwindCSS and NativeWind
- System Design & Analysis concepts applied in projects

### 3. Challenges Faced & Solutions
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|---------|
| Integrating Tab Navigation in Expo Router | Studied documentation and implemented `Tabs` with nested layouts |
| Styling React Native components with Tailwind | Learned NativeWind setup and converted styles into Tailwind classes |
| Handling API calls and asynchronous data | Used `async/await` with proper error handling and loading states |
| Managing project file structure | Adopted modular folder structure for screens, components, constants, and styles |

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
- Always structure code for scalability and reusability
- Use TypeScript for safer and maintainable code
- Test navigation and UI on both mobile and web platforms
- Document all learnings in a personal repository for future reference
- Collaborate actively with backend learners to integrate APIs smoothly

---

## Collaboration
- **Frontend Learners:** Share ideas, pair program, and solve UI challenges together
- **Backend Learners:** Use their endpoints and integrate APIs to complete projects
- **Communication Platform:** Discord (#ProDevProjectNexus) for updates, questions, and peer discussions

---

## Next Steps
- Continuously update this repository with new learnings
- Add detailed project examples with screenshots
- Showcase completed projects and demos
- Record video demos and link them here
